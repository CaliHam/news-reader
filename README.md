### [View Deployed Site](news-reader-orpin.vercel.app)

## Abstract: 
This site was built to assist with all your news needs! The homepage will show 6 articles at a time, to see more simply click on the arrow at the bottom for the next page. Don't see an article you like? Search for one in the top right corner using a keyword! The results will show the top trending articles with your keyword for today.

### Context:
I am currently in Mod 4 of the Turing Frontend Development Program. This application was built with the mindset of receiving a prompt for a potential job with the time constraints of building an app within 6-8 hours using [News API](https://newsapi.org/). A total of 8 hours were spent on this project.

### Requirements/Goals:
- Implement Typescript and Tailwind CSS in a simple application built mostly in one day
- A list of articles (headline, image, description if present, date)
- A “detailed” view for each article (headline, image, date, content, source)
   - Articles in the list must link to a detailed article view within your app (linking to the source website does not fulfill this requirement)
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

### Tech Stack
- Typescript, Tailwind CSS, React, React Router, FETCH API's
